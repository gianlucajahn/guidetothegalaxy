An optimistic glance into the future of human spaceflight, padded with a pinch of sarcasm. <br />
Natively open-source and forever free of cost.
 
 ## Specifications
Beyond Earth is a project with the goal of making aerospace engineering and spaceflight more accessible to the general public in consideration of the growing ubiquity we can expect for it in the following decades. Based on scientific papers, findings of recent years and educated guesses, the reader or listener is being taken on a thought experiment through what is one of the most likely scenarios for the future of human spaceflight. The project aims to leave readers and listeners with a substantial basic knowledge of spacetravel. The sensible structure and early introduction into physical systems and mathematical principles ensures that anyone, regardless of their professional background, can participate in the subject and follow history as it's written. After reading through our page, readers are very likely to have the fundamentals on spaceflight down and can engage in meaninful and constructive conversations about our possible future.

# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions ‚ùì
Here you'll find a list of frequently asked or quite obvious questions you might have about this page. Obviously, this will be expanded over time since there's no <em>frequently</em> asked questions before publishing the page for the first time.

## Why did you create this?
Well. Interests are a funny concept. It is impossible to define an objectively correct goal in one's life due to the nature of our universe being purely chaotic and not following any greater cause, intrinsically. Sure enough, maybe we're genereting 
energy for a higher-level civilization but within our universe, no interest or hobby is more valid or rational than any other, as long as you're not hurting anyone. That being said, I had some trouble making an interest in anything. I quickly learned though that
I like complicated questions and science in that scenario just so happened to be the perfect niche to be in. 

## Do you work in this field?
Not yet. As most of us, my life up to this point didn't go in a straight and predictable line and I bumped into a lot of issues that delayed me getting into astrophysics / aerospace engineering. I'm currently working as a software developer but I'm planning to
go back to university and study aerospace engineering in Germany. This isn't a dream or a plan B or anything that's uncertain since I cannot imagine any topic I could be more passionate about than this. Ever since I broke out in tears watching the Falcon 9 boosters land successfully
for the first time I knew there was no place for me to call home than this field and that's where I'm heading.

## Where are your sources?
You can find a .pdf file containing all sources for a page at the end of every page. Within this file, I usually reference the parts of the page the sources are referring to by numbers that can be found right next to said information within the page. You might for example find a little exponent right next to a piece of information like this: word¬≥. This would indicate the source for this piece of information is referenced by the number 3 within the source document.

## How can I contribute?
If you want to propose a topic or chapter, go ahead and shoot me a DM on discord, an email or an issue on this project's GitHub repo. Obviously, if you want to add a topic or chapter, you should have very good reasons to, so please be as specific and detailed as possible
about why this should be added. It's crucial for you to be able to provide sources for your reasonings or atleast explain them very rationally for me to consider them because that's exactly what it takes for me to consider my own ideas. 

As soon as we're done talking about the details of your idea, you can go ahead and:

- Fork <strong>[this repository](https://github.com/gianlucajahn/guidetothegalaxy)</strong>
- Clone it to your local environment
- Create a new branch and name it after your topic or chapter
- Add your content
- Commit and push your changes
- Create a Pull Request to this project's repository

I will then go ahead and review it. If all fits, it will be merged and you'll be listed as one of our contributors! ü•≥

## Premise
We have talked about nearly every potential to colonize other planets or the solar system around us. What's left is our curiosity: Not only for habitable living space outside of our current reach but also for other life that may prosper elsewhere, waiting to be come in touch with. We'll explore how aliens could be detected, how we are trying to detect them and what our findings were within the last couple of centuries.

We will also explore prominent concepts around the search for alien life, namely the Fermi Paradox, the Kardashev Scale and Great Filters.

## Content
In this chapter, we will learn about...

- Why alien life might or might not exist
- What the odds for alien life to form are
- The Fermi Paradox and what it might mean for us 
- The Kardashev Scale and consequently finding ways to detect alien life
- The concept of Great Filters
- Possible solutions for the Fermi Paradox

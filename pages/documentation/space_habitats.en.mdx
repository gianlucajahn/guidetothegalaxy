## Premise
The point we now arrived at is a point at which we'll come to peace with the fact that we colonized pretty much all of the planets that are worth colonizing within our solar system. Before emerging on a journey to other systems though, let's take a look at the hidden potential our solar system has to offer and how we can use it properly.

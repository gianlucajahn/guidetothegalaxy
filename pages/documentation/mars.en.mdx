## Premise
Now that we know how we would set up a basecamp and space station around the moon to have some first sort of cosmic settlement for human spaceflight, it's time to set sail for Mars. Before we venture into the catastrophically elaborate and time-consuming endevaour of trying to terraform Mars, we will make sure we have the neccessary infrastructure to do so, to become multiplanetary and to control this and other future operations on Mars. 

## Content
In this chapter, we will learn about...

- SpaceX plan for a first Basecamp on Mars
- SpaceX Plans for a first city on Mars
- Possible expansions of a first marsian city

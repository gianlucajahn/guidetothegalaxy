## Premise
In all of the previous chapters, we wondered about <strong>us</strong>. How are <strong>we</strong> going to colonize other planets? How are <strong>we</strong> going to find alien life? Within this last chapter, we want to drop our egocentrism and take a look at the grand scheme of things: What are our final borders, what's the fate of life in the universe and how is it going to end? 

## Content
In this chapter, we will learn about...

- The unconquerable borders of human space exploration
- The eventual fate of all life in the Universe
- The upcoming ages of the Universe and how they will change
- How the Universe will most likely "die"

## Bonus
- My personal take on the Universe and it's longevity
- A philosophical view on the meaning of life

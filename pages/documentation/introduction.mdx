Aerospace engineering, spacetravel (news) and research! All in one place.

## What is this?
This website features, as mentioned above, news all around spacetravel, articles explaining the content and relevance of recent papers and explanations about the math, chemistry and physics behind a lot of 
what makes space and spacetravel work. If you want to learn more about the background of this website, feel free to check out our <strong>[FAQ](https://guidetothegalaxy.vercel.app/FAQ)</strong>.

## This guide's structure
We will start with the most obvious first question when it comes to spacetravel, which is <strong>["Why should we pursue it at all?"](https://www.google.com)</strong> and will follow the (eventual) future path humanity will
take on through it. Aside the fact that either I, Gianluca (the author) or some other contributor evaluate scientific papers for their relevance towards human spacetravel,
this page is not one of them. This page can by no means guarantee that what we'll talk about is actually going to be reinacted by humans exactly, it's goal is simply to show 
what is possible and how those specific possible actions would be executed most efficiently based on our current understanding of physics. 

Furthermore, I maintain a rather sarcastic commentary style, 
on which I have received very positive feedback in my earlier german releases (see <strong>["Almost Everything Beyond"](https://www.docdroid.net/I85CJD1/almost-everything-beyond-pdf)</strong>) and which I will continue similarly. If this isn't for you, that's perfectly understandable.
Should the topic as such still be interesting to you, I would recommend you look at the "raw" sources I link under my documents yourself.

## This website's structure
If you are on desktop, you surely noticed navigation tables on both the left and right side of this paragraph. 

The left sided navigation lets you navigate through all pages and chapters and is
ordered chronologically in a logical manner, meaning any technical terms on an hypothetical page numbered `x` is explained on one of the pages numbered `x - y` whereas y is any <strong>[natural number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number)</strong>.

The right sided navigation lets you navigate through the article you are currently viewing. It features a list of all anchors (headlines) on the page and therefore lets you navigate through sub-chapters within
a page easily.

## News
Upon being done summarizing all of our journey up to our current understanding of physics and space around us, I will also introduce a "News" section to this website. Spacetravel is and will for many decades be a growing field that does 
not yet have any form of newspage that bundles all of the news around it. I intend to do that. Stay tuned or...

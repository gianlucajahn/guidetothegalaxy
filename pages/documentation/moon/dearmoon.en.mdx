## Civilian spaceflight
The latest step towards civilian spaceflight certainly was the <strong>[Inspiration4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspiration4)</strong> mission initiated by Jared Isaacman together with SpaceX. A group of all civilians, four in total, have been launched into space in a dragon capsule around Earth. Now, the dearMoon mission will be the next arguably small step towards making spaceflight more accessible to the general public:

Together with japanese billionaire Yusaka Maezawa, eight civilians set out on SpaceX Starship for a six day long trip around the moon, essentially following Apollo 13's trajectory. Maezawa's goal is to inspire people and to create awareness for the possibility of space tourism, hopefully increasing the interest and attention it gets from the general public. The mission is set to be launched within the fourth quarter of 2024 and will probably be broadcasted by SpaceX, similarly to prior launches.

## The Crew
Apart from many people from creative niches (musicians, dancers, DJs, content creators, actors, directors and photographers), there also is an athlete and <strong>[Tim Dodd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Dodd)</strong> planned to be on board for the mission, the man behind <strong>["Everyday Astronaut"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6uKrU_WqJ1R2HMTY3LIx5Q)</strong>, one of the biggest YouTube Channels in the Aerospace Engineering niche. 

Due to the fact that he is, apart from eventual crew members, the passenger with the most experience and knowledge about spacetravel, his insights from the mission are probably the most interesting and thorough.

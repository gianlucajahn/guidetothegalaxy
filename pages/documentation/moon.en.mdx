## Premise
Before we venture off to Mars, it would be beneficial to construct a lunar base camp and space station to have somewhat of an outpost in space without having to land on Earth. We will learn that human spacetravel and space exploration isn't one unified string of chronologically hand-crafted objectives but rather an interaction between multiple stakeholders, among them private companies as well as countries or even international agencies.

## Content
In this chapter, we will learn about...

- The upcoming dearMoon Mission by Yusaka Maezawa and SpaceX
- The Lunar Gateway, an extraterrestrial space station placed in lunar orbit
- The Artemis Lunar Basecamp built on the Moon as an outpost for human space exploration

## Premise
Before we venture off to Mars, it would be beneficial to construct a lunar base camp and space station to have somewhat of an outpost in space without having to land on Earth. We will learn that human spacetravel and space exploration isn't one unified string of chronologically hand-crafted objectives but rather an interaction between multiple stakeholders, among them private companies as well as countries or even international agencies.
